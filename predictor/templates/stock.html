        <div id="disclaimer"> 
            <p> The graph above shows actual {{ stock }} stock prices as well as predictions generated by
             an LSTM neural network ML model. The model was trained on approximately 200 days of 
             historical stock data from the last year, and then tested on the previous 50 or so 
             days of stock data. The graph depicts the model's predictions for the previous 30 days
             of stock data. It is my hope that general trends captured by the prediction curve may
             aid users in their knowledge of the future trajectory of stucks, <b>HOWEVER</b>, 
             please remember in the end that no one can accurately predict stock prices and this 
             is simply a personal project to pursue one of my interests. Make investments at your 
             own risk. </p>
